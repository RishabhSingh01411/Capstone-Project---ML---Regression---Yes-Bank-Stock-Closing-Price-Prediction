Project Summary: Forecasting Yes Bank's Monthly Stock Closing Prices Amidst Turbulence

This project focuses on predicting the monthly closing price of Yes Bank's stock, a crucial task for investors, stakeholders, and market participants given the bank's prominent position in India's financial sector. Yes Bank has faced significant challenges since 2018, notably the involvement of its co-founder, Rana Kapoor, in a fraud case. This situation, coupled with the bank's issues related to bad loans, has led to regulatory interventions by the Reserve Bank of India, making stock price prediction complex and uncertain.

To address this challenge, we leveraged a comprehensive dataset containing monthly stock price data from the bank's inception. This dataset provides essential metrics, including the monthly closing, opening, highest, and lowest stock prices. Our primary objective was to develop predictive models capable of capturing the intricate dynamics and trends in Yes Bank's stock prices, especially in light of the turbulent events and uncertainties affecting the bank's performance.

We explored various modeling techniques, focusing on time series models and regression methods, to evaluate their effectiveness in forecasting Yes Bank's stock closing prices. These models were specifically assessed on their ability to incorporate the impact of significant events, such as the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor and regulatory interventions by the Reserve Bank of India.

Successfully predicting Yes Bank's stock closing price could offer valuable insights for stakeholders, assisting them in making informed investment decisions. By navigating the complexities and uncertainties surrounding Yes Bank's stock prices, this project aims to enhance understanding of the bank's financial performance and contribute to more effective decision-making in the future.
